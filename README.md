# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data load

### Work in progress
So far this project only contains the data structure associated with the Olist public dataset. We use the public schema available on Kaggle. All the work here it's done with POSTGRESQL via PgAdmin4. 
Some queries were added for data visualization purposes. See [tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/juan.diego.p.rez.sierra/viz/Olist-EDASalesperformanceV1/Dashboard2?publish=yes) For a preliminary version of the dashboard.
